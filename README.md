# Organization of the Haxe Summit 2017

This repo acts as the main organization platform for the upcoming Haxe Summit. If you have a suggestion to make, a problem to report, a question to ask, a debate to open, you have come to the right place.

## Call For Speakers

We are inviting everyone in the community to propose sessions [through the issue tracker](https://github.com/HaxeSummit2017/organization/issues/new).

Each of the four conference days is split into a morning for talks that address all participants, and the afternoon for two parallel tracks that can explore more narrow subjects in depth, through workshops, tutorials and discussion panels. The tracks are designated to be about game and web development respectively, but this is more of a rough guideline than a strict imperative. If you wish to dive into a subject that cuts across both or intersects with none of them, that's perfectly fine.

We encourage the morning talks to be short and sweet, not unlike sales pitches, so that the recorded videos can basically act as promotion material for Haxe. Not all subjects lend themselves well for such condensed talks though - and that's not a problem. But if you can, try to focus on the very core of your message, highlight the unique features of your project and then expand on that in an afternoon workshop.
